i am currently enrolled in interactive media design in this project i make a comparison between dog and cat. I personally like both of them but still i make a comparison. I add images in index file and also link css file with index file While both animals have their own unique qualities and strengths, it ultimately comes down to personal preference.
Whether you prefer the social and interactive nature of dogs, or the independent and low-maintenance lifestyle of cats, both species have the potential to bring joy and happiness into your life. Ultimately, the best pet is one that fits your lifestyle, provides you with the companionship and love that you are looking for, and is well-suited to your living situation.
